**SPSS Data Analysis Project**
Overview
This project is a comprehensive SPSS-based statistical analysis conducted as part of my Master's curriculum at Saint Louis University. The objective was to derive actionable insights from a dataset through statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.

Methodology
Data Preparation: Dataset cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.
Descriptive Statistics: Computation of measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for initial insights.
Hypothesis Testing: Utilized t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to validate research hypotheses.
Correlation and Regression Analysis: Explored relationships among variables and predicted outcomes.
Visualization: Graphs and charts were generated using SPSS to highlight trends and patterns.

Results
Identified significant correlations between variables (p-value < 0.05).
Regression analysis indicated that variable X strongly predicts outcome Y (RÂ² = 0.87).
Hypothesis testing revealed that group differences were statistically significant.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective application of SPSS for statistical analysis and decision-making. The findings emphasize the importance of rigorous data analysis in deriving actionable business and research insights.
